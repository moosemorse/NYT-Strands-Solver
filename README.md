# NYT Strands Solver
I built this tool to help me solve the NYT strands whenever I'm too lazy to think. For example, you use a hint and you know where a word is but can't quite determine exactly what it is without trying every combination.

To use it: make a grid.txt file and run 'make'. You can find the executable in bin/ and just run the program. You can then specify the dimensions for which area you want to find a word. Results will be printed in a result.txt file, as well as how fast the process took.

# TODOs (potential)
=> Make this README more pretty
=> Add more useful error messages
=> Refactor to use more STL, instead of C-style syntax
=> Actually push work but I want to clean it up first
